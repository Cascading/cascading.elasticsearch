# Cascading-Elasticsearch

Cascading tap for Elasticsearch. This tap is modeled after the Pig bulk loader in [Wonderdog](https://github.com/infochimps/wonderdog). I couldn't use Wonderdog directly, as Wonderdog supports the newer, non-deprecated APIs. (These are incompatible with Cascading's choice of deprecated APIs.)

Ping me at @sritchie09 on Twitter or here on Github if you're interested in developing on this project. I've stalled out for now, but I'm happy to add any committer that's interested in taking this on.

## Usage

Stay away, completely alpha.
